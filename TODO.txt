11:26 am: havent the foggiest about how to start with this...
some kinda procedure is half forming in me noodle, but it seems a bit complicated 
perhaps it would be best to try this complicated way first and then simplify...

+ validate inputs
+ set state
- fix layout shift when error msg appears

+ diff validation for each input
+ fix is_valid bug
+ once validated do calc with current date
+ fix bug when birth month is the same as current month
- fix 0 months display
- fix day validation (its skipping right to date validation)
- display reset when any wrong input (maybe putting all inputs validations into 1 function)
